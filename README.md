# BBRv3 Performance Evaluation

## Overview

This repository contains resources related to the performance evaluation of BBRv3, a congestion control algorithm for optimizing network traffic. In this study, we assess the performance of BBRv3 under various scenarios and compare it to other congestion control algorithms, such as CUBIC. The paper associated with this research offers valuable insights into BBRv3's behavior and its suitability for different networking conditions.

This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of BBRv3, considering scenarios with different numbers of competing flows, RTTs, loss rates, and buffer sizes. The experiments shed light on BBRv3's coexistence with CUBIC, its resilience to packet losses, fairness considerations, queue occupancy, bottleneck bandwidth estimation, flow completion times, and optimal configurations in various network conditions.
